✅ TWO MAJOR FIXES APPLIED
===========================

🔧 ISSUE 1: GADGET CONDITION FIELD
-----------------------------------

PROBLEM:
Gadget condition was a number input (0-100 rating) while Games 
had proper condition options (New, Like New, Good, etc.)

SOLUTION APPLIED ✅

1. Changed Add Form:
   ❌ Before: Number input (0-100)
   ✅ After: Dropdown with options

2. Changed Edit Modal:
   ❌ Before: Number input (0-100)
   ✅ After: Dropdown with options

3. Condition Options:
   • New
   • Like New
   • Good
   • Fair
   • Poor

   Note: Games also have "Digital" option, but that doesn't 
   make sense for physical gadgets, so it's excluded.

4. Updated Form Handlers:
   • Add form saves condition as text
   • Edit form saves condition as text
   • Dropdown populated on page load

📋 GADGET CONDITION DROPDOWN
-----------------------------
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Condition ▼             │
│ ┌─────────────────────┐ │
│ │ Select condition    │ │
│ │ New                 │ │
│ │ Like New            │ │
│ │ Good                │ │
│ │ Fair                │ │
│ │ Poor                │ │
│ └─────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────┘

✅ RESULT: Professional condition tracking, consistent with Games!


🔧 ISSUE 2: CARD EXPANSION BUG
-------------------------------

PROBLEM:
When clicking to expand a card, ALL cards in the same row would 
expand visually (stretch in height), but only the clicked card 
would show details. Other cards just became blank tall boxes.

ROOT CAUSE:
CSS Grid's default behavior is to make all items in a row match 
the tallest item's height. When one card expanded, the grid row 
grew, forcing other cards to stretch to fill that height.

SOLUTION APPLIED ✅

Added `align-items: start` to .items-grid CSS:

.items-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
    gap: 20px;
    margin-top: 24px;
    align-items: start;  ← THIS FIXES IT!
}

📊 BEHAVIOR NOW
---------------

BEFORE FIX:
┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Card 1 │ │ Card 2 │ │ Card 3 │
│        │ │        │ │        │
└────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
     ↓ Click Card 2
┌────────┐ ┌────────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Card 1 │ │ Card 2     │ │ Card 3 │
│        │ │ [Details]  │ │        │
│ BLANK  │ │ [Details]  │ │ BLANK  │
│ STRETCH│ │ [Buttons]  │ │ STRETCH│
└────────┘ └────────────┘ └────────┘
   ⚠️ Cards 1 & 3 stretch but show nothing!

AFTER FIX:
┌────────┐ ┌────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Card 1 │ │ Card 2 │ │ Card 3 │
│        │ │        │ │        │
└────────┘ └────────┘ └────────┘
     ↓ Click Card 2
┌────────┐ ┌────────────┐ ┌────────┐
│ Card 1 │ │ Card 2     │ │ Card 3 │
│        │ │ [Details]  │ │        │
└────────┘ │ [Details]  │ └────────┘
           │ [Buttons]  │
           └────────────┘
   ✅ Only Card 2 expands! Others stay compact!

✅ WHAT IT MEANS
----------------
• Click any card → Only THAT card expands
• Other cards in the row stay their original size
• No more blank stretched cards
• Clean, professional behavior
• Works for Gadgets, Games, and Digital sections


🎯 SUMMARY OF CHANGES
---------------------

FILE LOCATIONS:
• Add Form: Line ~1900 (condition field)
• Edit Modal: Line ~6512 (condition field)
• Dropdown Population: Line ~3588 (updateAllDropdowns)
• Form Handlers: Lines ~4188, ~4469 (save as text)
• CSS Fix: Line ~680 (align-items: start)

TESTING:
✅ Add new gadget with condition dropdown
✅ Edit gadget condition using dropdown
✅ Click to expand one card - others stay normal size
✅ Works in all sections (Gadgets, Games, Digital)


💡 TECHNICAL DETAILS
--------------------

Why align-items: start works:
By default, grid items use `align-items: stretch` which makes all 
items in a row stretch to match the tallest item. By setting it to 
`start`, each card only takes up the height it needs for its own 
content, independent of other cards in the row.

This is the correct CSS fix for grid layouts where items should 
not influence each other's heights.


✅ BOTH ISSUES FULLY RESOLVED! 🎉
